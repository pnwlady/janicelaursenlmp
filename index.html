        About Me
      </h2>
    </section>

    <section class="section section--description">
      	<p class="color--darkgrey section__description">
			I was born on Shaw Island, a small jewel nestled in the San Juan Islands, Washington. Having the privilege of living close to the earth established a deep relationship of respect and gratitude of Earth, for all the benefits we experience in our bodies from the simplicity of nature. This set a blueprint of health and vitality that I use in my energy work and massage. 		  
		</p>
		<p class="color--darkgrey section__description">
			Our bodies are a reflection of the earth, our blood and lymphatic system the rivers and oceans, our bones the plates, stone, and trees holding the soil - our soft tissues. The magnet pull of the earth is the same motion as the tides of our cerebral spinal fluid and energetic system. Our breath the air, where does our breath stop or is unable to inhabit? All of this contributes to our Nervous system (all the sensory information to our brain which tells our muscles what to do) which affects our Endocrine system (how we think and feel). How are these functioning together? Are our waters properly moving or stagnant, are they filtering well? Do we have pain in where bone meets bone? Muscle meets vertebrae?		  
		</p>
		<p class="color--darkgrey section__description">
			This is a small glimpse of how I think when working with the body. Reestablishing relationship between our waters, bone, soft tissue, breath, energetic systems, nervous system, endocrine system, and being-ness, is what excites me, makes me curious and keeps me always learning.

			<p class="color--darkgrey section__description">
				I lived and studied energy and bodywork in Seattle for 13 years.
			</p>
			<p class="color--darkgrey section__description">
				I worked at Brenneke Massage School, which later transitioned into Cortiva, merging two of Washington's best massage schools, Brenneke and Brian Utting.  
			</p>
			<p class="color--darkgrey section__description">
				Although I was in administration initially, I was surrounded by massage and the culture it cultivates. Massage culture is rich in engaged communication, ethics, healthy boundaries, clinical diagnostic thinking while always holding sovereign respect for each individual and their path.  Not to mention, all the bodywork I received regularly which created relationship with all my moving pieces,  helped me move into deeper relaxation and stillness then I had, thus far, experienced.  My eight years at massage school changed my life, communication, perception, interactions, movement, and in turn my relationships with myself and others. I am deeply grateful for that time in my life. 
			</p>
			<p class="color--darkgrey section__description">
				It was also a hub of master teachers. Some I had in the classroom there or would later find in my continuing education.
			</p>
			<p class="color--darkgrey section__description">
				Before Massage school I had been introduced to and became passionate about Energy work and Reiki.  Looking back now I see the blueprint of nature from my childhood in this curiosity. My body knew the difference.  Why do we feel so good when we go outside? This asked me to examine the energetics of rejuvenation and vitality versus density in our fields and bodies, even soul. It was something I self learned at first and then pursued.  I took Reiki level 1 and 2. I have taken classes in Earth Energy, the Energetic fields, studied the Chakra systems, how energy moves through our body or lack there of.  I have studied some Chinese medicine as well as Ayurveda, two of the most ancient forms of health and wellness. 
			</p>
			<p class="color--darkgrey section__description">
				All of this has culminated in me using the best tools I have in each personalized session dependent on what you are needing and asking for with respect and curiosity.
			</p>
			<p class="color--darkgrey section__description">
				May we walk in gratitude and vibrancy,
