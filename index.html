        About Me
      </h2>
    </section>

    <section class="section section--alignCentered section--description">
      	<p class="color--darkgrey section__description">
		  I was born on Shaw Island a small jewel nestled in the San Juan Islands. It was only a matter of time before finding another Island paradise like Whidbey to call home.
		  I lived and studied energy and bodywork in Seattle for 13 years.
		  I worked at Brenneke Massage School, which later transitioned into Cortiva, merging two of Washingtons best massage schools, Brenneke and Brian Utting.  
		  Although I was in administration I was surrounded by massage and the culture it cultivates. I learned so much about my body just from all the massage I received.  This cultivation of body awareness and experiencing deep relaxation changed my communication, perception, interactions, movement and in turn my relationships with myself and others.  
		  After 6 years of administration, I went through massage school and uncovered a passion for learning about our amazing bodies, nervous system and brain, something I will be teachable in for a lifetime.  Having teachers from both Brenneke and Brian Utting, I received wonderful training in Swedish relaxation and clinical treatment.
		  Long before Massage school I pursued  Reiki level 1 and 2 and had been using it on myself and others for years.
		  I had the privilege of apprenticing with Robert Lester the 2nd. He taught me a culmination of cranial sacral, acupressure, and Qi Gong while always holding teachings in the civility of Cree tradition. Such wealth of knowledge, I studied with him for 2 years tying all these beautiful modalities together as well as honoring the Cree teachings.  This made for 2 very rich years of deep growth and change in myself and what kind of work and space I want to provide.
		  Post massage school I have been in the classroom a lot, feeding my curiosity and passion for learning more, about our complex bodies.
